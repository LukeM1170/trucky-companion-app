## Why this app?

I'm learning React Native and i'm a trucker (i play Euro Truck Simulator on multiplayer via [TruckersMP mod](https://truckersmp.com/)) so i want to try and learn on a real case using a set of API already built from TruckersMP developers.

Meetups are downloaded from [ETS2 Convoys](http://ets2c.com)

Live MAP and online status check is integrated via webiew from [ETS2 Map](http://ETS2map.com) and its api.

I'm not affiliated in any way with SCS, Euro Truck Simulator 2 or TruckersMP.
